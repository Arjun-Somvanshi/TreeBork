# TreeBork
A time table for college students
TreeBork is an app to look up the schedule of your classes really quick, if you are in a hurry and can't wait for the internet to load your college website, or just don't want to install any college software, since it might be spyware of some kind or you just don't trust it in general, you can go ahead and use this app since it's an open-source solution and light weight.

## Features
* It's completely offline
* It can be used as a task manager since the entries can be deleted and added easily
* It has an intutive design for adding and managing subjects of different types: theory and lab
* It is in-sync with the current date and time, so you don't need to enter subjects in a given order, you can add a few now, and the rest later, it will sort things for you
* It's available on Windows, Android and Linux
* It has three good looking themes that it ships with, you can easily make your own themes in the settings section
* It's still under development and this is all I could think of for now, I hope you enjoy a spyware free phone!
* NO PERMISSIONS NEEDED to run.

## How to use this?
Treebork is quite simple, on a weekend just pull up your schedule from the internet/college resource and fill it in the application, using the "Add a subject" button on the main screen. Now you have got everything offline with features like seeing the time table for any day quickly, adding or removing subjects etc. Also the fact that the schedule for the right day is loaded when you start the applilcation, so you don't have to search for the timings or schedule.
