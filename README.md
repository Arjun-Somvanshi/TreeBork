# TreeBork
A time table for college students
TreeBork is an app to look up the schedule of your classes really quick, if you are in a hurry and can't wait for the internet to load your college website, or just don't want to install any college software, since it might be spyware of some kind or you just don't trust it in general, you can go ahead and use this app since it's an open-source solution and quite minmalistic looking.

## Features
* Treebork is quite simple, on a sunday just pull up your schedule from the internet and fill it in the app, using the "Add a subject" button, and now you have got       everything offline with features like showing the next upcoming class, and also the schedule for the right day, so you don't have to search for the timings or   schedule. 
* It has a three good looking themes that it ships with, you can easily make your own themes in the settings section
* It's still under development and this is all I could think of for now, I hope you enjoy a spyware free phone!
